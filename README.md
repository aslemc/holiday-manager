# holiday-manager

This repository contains my second Python assessment for the Dev10 training that I completed. 

The main goal of this assessment was to create a simple text-based application to manage holidays meeting the following broad requirements:

* Preload starter holidays from a JSON file as well as 5 years worth of holidays from timeanddate.com/holidays/us
* Save all holidays to a JSON file
* Represent holidays as objects
* Represent the list of holidays as an object
* Use a lambda expression to print holidays for a selected week
